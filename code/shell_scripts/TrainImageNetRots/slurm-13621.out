WARNING:tensorflow:From train_image_classifier_biasCNN.py:663: Print (from tensorflow.python.ops.logging_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2018-08-20.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.print instead of tf.Print. Note that tf.print returns a no-output operator that directly prints the output. Outside of defuns or eager mode, this operator will not be executed unless it is directly specified in session.run or used as a control dependency for other operators. This is only a concern in graph mode. Below is an example of how to ensure tf.print executes in graph mode:
```python
    sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    with sess.as_default():
        tensor = tf.range(10)
        print_op = tf.print(tensor)
        with tf.control_dependencies([print_op]):
          out = tf.add(tensor, tensor)
        sess.run(out)
    ```
Additionally, to use tf.print in python 2.7, users must make sure to import
the following:

  `from __future__ import print_function`
